# Advanced MPR Viewer Program! 🎉

Developed a sophisticated medical imaging application for interactive visualization of brain MRI scans (NIFTI format), enabling efficient analysis for medical professionals.
## 📌 Core Features:

- Multi-planar visualization with synchronized axial, sagittal, and coronal views
- Real-time image processing with interactive crosshairs and hover guidelines
- Advanced brightness/contrast controls with dynamic view updates
- Precise 3D navigation through slider controls and numeric entry

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation:

- Built with Python using Tkinter for GUI development
- Integrated Matplotlib for high-quality medical image rendering
- Leveraged NiBabel library for neuroimaging file processing
- Implemented real-time synchronization across multiple views

The application streamlines neuroimaging analysis workflow while maintaining professional-grade visualization standards and intuitive user experience.
